I will fight for what I love until the day I die. \n \nForgiveness is love.  Love is a verb.  Choose to love.  Choose to forgive.  Choose to fight for what's worth fighting for.  Fight for your love, fight for your passion.  Never give up.  Never quit.  Give as many chances as there are stars in the sky.  And when the world gives you a million reasons to quit, find that one reason to keep trying.\n\nLove is intentional.\nLove is sacrificial.\nLove is an investment.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \nAnd neither the flower nor the insect will ever understand the significance of their lovemaking. I mean, how could they know that because of their little dance the world lives? But it does. By simply doing what they're designed to do, something large and magnificent happens. In this sense they show us how to live - how the only barometer you have is your heart. How, when you spot your flower, you can't let anything get in your way.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate it, I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTruth is still absolute. Believe that. Even when that truth is hard and cold, and more painful than you've ever imagined. And even when truth is more cruel than any lie.\n\n\"You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect - you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break - her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.\" -Bob Marley\n\nInstructions for life:\n1. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.\n2. Memorize your favourite poem.\n3. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.\n4. When you say, \"I love you,\" mean it.\n5. When you say, \"I'm sorry,\" look the person in the eye.\n6. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.\n7. Believe in love at first sight.\n8. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.\n9. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.\n10. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.\n11. Don't judge people by their relatives.\n12. Talk slowly but think quickly.\n13. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, \"Why do you want to know?\"\n14. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.\n15. Say \"bless you\" when you hear someone sneeze.\n16. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.\n17. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; Responsibility for all your actions.\n18. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.\n19. When you realise you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.\n20. Smile when picking up the telephone. The caller will hear it in your voice.\n21. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.\n22. Spend some time alone.\n23. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.\n24. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.\n25. Read more books and watch less TV.\n26. Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll get to enjoy it a second time.\n27. Trust in God but lock your car.\n28. A loving atmosphere in your home is so important. Do all you can to create a tranquil harmonious home.\n29. In disagreements with loved ones, deal with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.\n30. Read between the lines.\n31. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality.\n32. Be gentle with the earth.\n33. Pray. There's immeasurable power in it.\n34. Never interrupt when you are being flattered.\n35. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.\n36. Don't trust a man/woman who doesn't close his/her eyes when you kiss.\n37. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.\n38. If you make a lot of money, put it to use helping others while you are living. That is wealth's greatest satisfaction.\n39. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a stroke of luck.\n40. Learn the rules then break some.\n41. Remember that the best relationship is one where your love for each other is greater than your need for each other.\n42. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.\n43. Remember that your character is your destiny.\n44. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.\n\n<3 RIP DT <3\n10/25/85-2/20/11\nYou were in my life for only a short time, but you left your mark on me and I will remember you in a very special place in my heart forever.

human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect.\" \nRonald Reagan\n\nI'm Sean Rayburn, what else is there to say? I'm into sports and drama, and i like hanging out with friends. I write a lot, and I feel like I think a lot better either out loud or on paper than I do in my head. The written word is mankind's greatest achievement, and without literature we're doomed. I love listening to people talk and hearing new ideas, though I don't always agree with them. I've got a big family, so I've been surrounded by chaos my whole life. Five of my best friends friends are my brothers and my sister. I'm loud and I can sometimes be annoying, but I mean well. I've been called a Jesus freak, but I'm not gonna try to hide what I believe. Although I have some issues with what the church in America looks like, I still think that God is my best friend and He is the only road to happiness or peace in this world. I'm more conservative, mostly because I think that the government can only do so much to fix a problem. It's up to individuals, up to the citizens to really make a difference.","birthday":"01/06/1991","education":[{"school":{"id":"103978059637663","name":"Newnan High School"},"year":{"id":"136328419721520","name":"2009"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"103701829668977","name":"Mercer University"},"year":{"id":"120960561375312","name":"2013"},"concentration":[{"id":"165088236876796","name":"Creative Writing/English Literature"},{"id":"189792734375075","name":"Theatre Minor"},{"id":"421015511250590","name":"Underwater basket weaving"}],"type":"College"}],"website":"http://silverhand-silverhand.blogspot.com/","work":[{"employer":{"id":"124543890964355","name":"East Macon Pool"},"location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"102796173090187","name":"Lifeguard"}},{"employer":{"id":"107638515361","name":"Mercer University"},"location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"143913795632331","name":"Preceptor"}}],"id":"576567228","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/369506_576567228_98643313_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/christine.massih","name":"Christine Lyra Massih","first_name":"Christine","middle_name":"Lyra","last_name":"Massih","locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"christine.massih","third_party_id":"xRGU-B2TaapYLqtoZ1UOyzdTQjA","updated_time":"2012-10-22T01:32:00+0000","devices":[{"os":"Android"}],"id":"584473427","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/211352_584473427_1032838764_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/mika3la","name":"Mikaela Davis","first_name":"Mikaela","last_name":"Davis","location":{"id":"115575195126165","name":"Potsdam, New York"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"mika3la","third_party_id":"3GYTH43dTjJlwU5M1Wy99kY0Oio","updated_time":"2012-10-21T03:52:39+0000","bio":"If you are here to listen to my music, or stay updated on shows, please go here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/MikaelaDavisMusic\r\n\r\n:)","birthday":"04/09/1992","devices":[{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPhone"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"103761732996289","name":"Penfield High School"},"year":{"id":"142963519060927","name":"2010"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"109320645752654","name":"Crane School of Music"},"year":{"id":"143641425651920","name":"2014"},"concentration":[{"id":"202158599800198","name":"Harp Performance"}],"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"110520035642001","name":"SUNY Potsdam"},"type":"College"}],"significant_other":{"name":"Josh Netsky","id":"1381950023"},"website":"http://www.purevolume.com/MikaelaDavis\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/MikaelaDavisMusic\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/MikaelaDavisMusic","id":"590702577","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/372599_590702577_733844308_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/graftontanner","name":"Grafton Tanner","first_name":"Grafton","last_name":"Tanner","location":{"id":"103990676304130","name":"Athens, Georgia"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"male","username":"graftontanner","third_party_id":"loGcYcN1DlVAZtLzxGQzRCPc3f4","updated_time":"2012-10-20T15:43:57+0000","bio":"Drummers do it better.","birthday":"08/26/1990","devices":[{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPhone"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"110490915640867","name":"Tattnall Square Academy"},"year":{"id":"136328419721520","name":"2009"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"21657666681","name":"University of Georgia"},"year":{"id":"138879996141011","name":"2013"},"concentration":[{"id":"109152432447552","name":"Sorcery"},{"id":"101874799854968","name":"Film Studies"}],"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"21657666681","name":"University of Georgia"},"type":"College"}],"website":"http://www.theblueindian.com/meet-the-writers/grafton-tanner/\nhttp://mubi.com/users/63907","work":[{"employer":{"id":"149404111750736","name":"TheBlueIndian.com"},"position":{"id":"107507365936659","name":"Writer"},"start_date":"0000-00"}],"id":"597281270","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/276072_597281270_748412177_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/lyndssey.autrey","name":"Lyndssey Leanne Autrey","first_name":"Lyndssey","middle_name":"Leanne","last_name":"Autrey","location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"lyndssey.autrey","third_party_id":"YHKQdGmXyeQMqCrB8vNcXIjr2zo","updated_time":"2012-10-13T02:01:42+0000","bio":"A thousand times I've failed\r\nstill Your mercy remains\r\n& should I stumble again\r\nI'm caught in Your grace ♥\r\n\r\n♥ MissLyndsseyLeanne ♥ \r\nIm 19 years old. \r\nBorn on March 19th. \r\nI'm a sophomore at Mercer University\r\nKatie Beyer = My Bestie. \r\nMy ♥loves♥ are: \r\nMy friends. \r\nMy family. \r\nShopping. \r\nSwimming. \r\nSoccer. \r\n& Country Music. \r\nIm a proud Christian. \r\nI love God!

If you want to know anything else, just ask.","birthday":"06/10/1990","education":[{"school":{"id":"109203795766217","name":"Trinity Christian School"},"year":{"id":"141778012509913","name":"2008"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"103701829668977","name":"Mercer University"},"concentration":[{"id":"191257677563906","name":"Industrial Management"}],"type":"College"}],"work":[{"employer":{"id":"109527325742398","name":"Farmers Home Furniture"},"location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"139636372799106","name":"Warehouse/Collections"},"start_date":"2011-08"},{"employer":{"id":"109527325742398","name":"Farmers Home Furniture"},"location":{"id":"108758395814738","name":"Dublin, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"133161436719281","name":"Information Systems Intern"},"description":"Corporate office: Worked with active directories, computer imaging and troubleshooting, creating user accounts and adding software to store computers, sent out computers and hardware for store usage","start_date":"2011-07","end_date":"2011-08"},{"employer":{"id":"60686173217","name":"Kroger"},"location":{"id":"108758395814738","name":"Dublin, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"148637871819739","name":"Courtesy Clerk"},"start_date":"2005-12","end_date":"2007-08"},{"employer":{"id":"113119898037","name":"Wesley Foundation of Macon"}}],"id":"614118043","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/161504_614118043_580299_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/richard.loper1","name":"Richard Loper","first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Loper","location":{"id":"","name":null},"locale":"en_US","gender":"male","username":"richard.loper1","third_party_id":"YWiTzkevaRy8Z5YvIBZTAeMq4tE","updated_time":"2012-06-06T11:33:40+0000","birthday":"04/21/1989","devices":[{"os":"Android"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"106075739423691","name":"Evans High School"},"year":{"id":"140617569303679","name":"2007"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"103701829668977","name":"Mercer University"},"concentration":[{"id":"109532545739630","name":"Engineering"}],"type":"College"}],"website":"n/a","work":[{"employer":{"id":"113119898037","name":"Wesley Foundation of Macon"}}],"id":"616495661","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/48584_616495661_7235_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/ednamamd","name":"Edna Ma","first_name":"Edna","last_name":"Ma","location":{"id":"110970792260960","name":"Los Angeles, California"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"ednamamd","languages":[{"id":"106059522759137","name":"English"},{"id":"104097829626659","name":"Cantonese"},{"id":"103088979730830","name":"Mandarin Chinese"}],"third_party_id":"v63nn4i3HherjS8iMM_f0N1uVtg","updated_time":"2012-07-12T17:14:29+0000","bio":"Survivor: South Pacific Contestant Season 23","devices":[{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPhone"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"83086245170","name":"University of Colorado Boulder"},"year":{"id":"144503378895008","name":"1999"},"type":"College"}],"id":"619841083","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/157169_619841083_1160716759_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/stims1","name":"Sarah Tims","first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"Tims","location":{"id":"111903195493464","name":"Evansville, Indiana"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"stims1","third_party_id":"QRE3Fqd8QKXwISBDSgyVz4Rm198","updated_time":"2012-09-02T01:51:33+0000","birthday":"10/05","devices":[{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPhone"}],"id":"620216213","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/49038_620216213_1453357099_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/aaron.j.mcginnis","name":"Aaron John McGinnis","first_name":"Aaron","middle_name":"John","last_name":"McGinnis","location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"male","username":"aaron.j.mcginnis","languages":[{"id":"110343528993409","name":"Spanish"}],"third_party_id":"XCYLbMEXDtkbDHnKpmS7QKJQnh4","updated_time":"2012-05-18T00:07:23+0000","bio":"All Consuming Fire You're Our heart's desire, Living Flame of Love, Come baptize us, come baptize us.

I'm random and spontanious. I can be a \"go getter\" when i wanna be. I'm honest and loyal but hardly ever know what i really want. I have a bad habit of running away from the things that might be good for me. My goal in life is to fulfill His purpose for me,i'm not totally sure what that is just yet. But i am happy to say that i have had a past that would probably break your heart but i am so thank for every tear i have shed because i that much stronger and my future is as bright as the sun.

About one year ago an MC named JuBee was following his path in search of that mysterious smooth jam. Not knowing what the future held for him he battled through galaxy after galaxy until he came upon a planet known to many as Macon, Georgia. It is here where he soon came across a band of 3 noble hipsters(Alex,Danny,Alec), who were also on the same mission. Together they took on gangs of country music fans and fought their way to the top of Cherry Street Hill. Once they made it to the top there was a loud explosion, and with this explosion came the remarkable power of smoothness and smooth jams...And music as we know it was changed forever with the birth of JuBee and The Morning After....\r\n\r\nJuBee and The Morning After is a band composed of JuBee of City Council (Lead Singer) , Alex Scarborough (Drummer) and Danny Davis (Bassist) both formerly of Dope John Paul, eighteen year old prodigy, Alec Stanley (Guitarist) and Matt Sphinx (Synthesizer and Keys) both formerly of The Alec Stanley Seven. These five artist come together each with their own styles and created a electric hybrid sound that is truly invigorating.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JuBee and Alex met three years ago when JuBee first came to Macon, Georgia. They became good friends and fans of each other’s music. After a Jam session at Alex’s house in June 2010 the decided to collaborate musically. The search for a bassist and guitarist began to complete their band. They didn’t have to look far soon after the session Alex introduced JuBee to his fellow band mate Danny Davis who had been working in the hip-hop world making beats in Athens, Georgia. Danny jumped at the chance and added JuBee to the next Dope John Paul show, which unfortunately was Dope John Paul’s last show.  Now the trio set out to find a guitarist, they held auditions for their fellow musicians, including Alex’s long time family friend Alec Stanley. After hearing Alec and Matt play together for the first time JuBee knew they had to be included in the band. After their first show the excitement finally hit JuBee that he the Morning After would leave their mark in this world. And now JuBee and the Morning After are ion top of the Macon music scene and refuse to stop.","birthday":"01/29/1987","education":[{"school":{"id":"110761422285484","name":"Rutland High School"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"107484305947894","name":"Georgia Military College"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"108567889174971","name":"Central High School, Macon, GA"},"year":{"id":"140617569303679","name":"2007"},"type":"High School"},{"school":{"id":"107799939248465","name":"Georgia Southern University"},"year":{"id":"118118634930920","name":"2012"},"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"108216109206808","name":"Georgia College & State University"},"year":{"id":"138879996141011","name":"2013"},"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"109508679069130","name":"Macon State College"},"year":{"id":"142963519060927","name":"2010"},"concentration":[{"id":"112936425387489","name":"Music"}],"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"108097985878828","name":"Central Georgia Technical College"},"year":{"id":"142963519060927","name":"2010"},"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"21657666681","name":"University of Georgia"},"year":{"id":"142963519060927","name":"2010"},"type":"College"},{"school":{"id":"103701829668977","name":"Mercer University"},"year":{"id":"142963519060927","name":"2010"},"concentration":[{"id":"112092048806093","name":"Business Marketing"},{"id":"109439469082967","name":"Music Education"}],"type":"College"}],"significant_other":{"name":"Dwayne 'JuBee' Webb","id":"1489290062"},"website":"http://www.facebook.com/jubeeandthemorningafter\r\n\r\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/jubeeandthemorningafter\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sonicbids.com/Jubeeandthemorningafter\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/JuBeeATMA","work":[{"employer":{"id":"171441219567123","name":"TMA Entertainment"},"location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"position":{"id":"143781558979781","name":"Boss"}},{"employer":{"id":"147715048573303","name":"Lyricist"}},{"employer":{"id":"161878737164341","name":"Andersen's Jewelers"}},{"employer":{"id":"102045179840140","name":"Self Employed and Loving It!"},"from":{"id":"1801137610","name":"Rheii Williams"},"projects":[{"id":"140914829273054","name":"Saxophonist","with":[{"id":"1801137610","name":"Rheii Williams"}],"from":{"id":"1801137610","name":"Rheii Williams"}}]}],"id":"100001875707749","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc6/273655_100001875707749_1016615341_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/jamal.jefferson.3150","name":"Jamal Jefferson","first_name":"Jamal","last_name":"Jefferson","location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"male","username":"jamal.jefferson.3150","languages":[{"id":"113243445352530","name":"Creole"}],"third_party_id":"rCL28DNyQHZfEVduCOO0DvnEZO0","updated_time":"2012-07-04T04:18:14+0000","birthday":"02/18/1991","id":"100001948180206","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/161501_100001948180206_3725201_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/tripp.freeman","name":"Tripp Freeman","first_name":"Tripp","last_name":"Freeman","location":{"id":"105745629459139","name":"Macon, Georgia"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"male","username":"tripp.freeman","third_party_id":"6nSo5IrRa104GK1q2pLokMbtWJg","updated_time":"2012-10-20T18:50:03+0000","birthday":"10/16","devices":[{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPad"},{"os":"iOS","hardware":"iPhone"}],"education":[{"school":{"id":"107909092576635","name":"Central GA Tech"},"year":{"id":"140617569303679","name":"2007"},"type":"College"}],"significant_other":{"name":"Christy Freeman","id":"764444596"},"work":[{"employer":{"id":"107922765902088","name":"Trane"}}],"id":"100001967703626","picture":{"data":{"url":"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/370655_100001967703626_1088515848_q.jpg","is_silhouette":false}}},{"link":"http://www.facebook.com/pshallow","name":"Parvati Shallow","first_name":"Parvati","last_name":"Shallow","location":{"id":"109683405724572","name":"Santa Monica, California"},"locale":"en_US","gender":"female","username":"pshallow","third_party_id":"Ox5Uq1Z2ZEU2_-j36_PArDCfvLg","updated_time":"2012-07-17T21:58:28+0000","bio":"Co-Founder of ESP Wellness Center in Santa Monica, California.
