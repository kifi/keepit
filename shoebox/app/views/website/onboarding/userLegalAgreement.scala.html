        <h2>Hi, Effi Fuks-Leichtag</h2>
        <h3 class="blue">We're in early beta — mind doing us a favor?</h3>
    </header>
    
    <p>We're working hard to make a great product that we, our friends, you, and your friends will absolutely love. As a beta tester, you'll get first access and a direct line to us for features and help. In exchange, for this early-beta period, please don't talk about KiFi to people who haven't joined yet.</p>
    <p>Below are the terms our lawyers said we have to have. It boils down to:
      <ul>
        <li>Be nice to us and others.</li>
        <li>While we're in early-beta, don't talk about what we're doing.</li>
        <li>Enjoy KiFi!</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Beta Test Agreement</h3>

<p>This Beta Test Agreement (this “Agreement”) is by and between FortyTwo, Inc. (“Licensor”) and the individual or entity that has downloaded, installed and/or used the Software (“Participant”).  The “Effective Date” of this Agreement will be the date on which Participant clicks the “I ACCEPT” button as referred to below.
PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT, AND BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" AND DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, PARTICIPANT AGREES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT IN FULL.  IF PARTICIPANT IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, PARTICIPANT HEREBY REPRESENTS THAT PARTICIPANT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY.  THE LICENSE IS CONDITIONED UPON THE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF PARTICIPANT DOES NOT OR CANNOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, PARTICIPANT SHOULD CLICK THE “CANCEL” BUTTON AND MUST NOT FURTHER DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

<p>License Grant.  Subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants to Participant a personal, royalty-free, nonsublicensable, nontransferable, nonexclusive license (the “License”) to install and use the Beta version of Licensor’s proprietary [search application]  (“Software”) in order to test its performance and functions in the manner specified herein and as may also be provided to Participant in related documentation supplied by Licensor only for Participant’s testing and evaluation purposes as part of Licensor’s Beta test project (the “Beta test”).
<p>Testing.  Participant agrees to test and evaluate the Software as instructed by Licensor.  Participant agrees to install Licensor’s client Software (provided by Licensor) on Participant’s personal computer upon commencement of the Beta test and register with Licensor as an Beta tester pursuant to Licensor’s instructions. Participant will promptly report to Licensor any problems or defects encountered in the Software at all times during the Beta test. 
<p>License Restrictions. Participant agrees to use the Software only in the ordinary course of testing the Software, and except as expressly permitted herein, shall not reproduce, distribute, deploy, publicly display or modify the Software or any portion thereof.  Except to the extent that the following restriction is prohibited by applicable law, if any, Participant shall not (i) reverse assemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any software source code or other components of the Software, (ii) in any manner attempt to defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or circumvent any software protection mechanisms in the Software, (iii) attempt in any manner to derive the source code or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organization of the Software or (iv) otherwise attempt to discover any other underlying Proprietary Information (as that term is defined below).   
<p>Ownership.  Except as expressly licensed in Section 1 above, as between the parties, Licensor shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Software, Proprietary Information and any intellectual property rights embodied therein.  The Software is and contains trade secrets, proprietary rights and other intellectual property of Licensor.
<p>Confidentiality.  Participant shall maintain the confidentiality of the Software, and shall not disclose any aspect of the Beta test, including that the Software exists and is being tested, or any aspect of the testing or evaluation performed by Participant (including the fact that Participant is acting as an Beta tester) under this Agreement.  Participant acknowledges that, in the course of using the Software and performing the duties under this Agreement, Participant may obtain or develop information relating to the Software or Licensor (“Proprietary Information”), including, but not limited to, technology, software code, know-how, ideas, testing procedures, structure, interfaces, documentation, problem reports, development schedule, analysis and performance information, and other technical, business, product, marketing and financial information, plans and data.  During and after the term of this Agreement, Participant shall hold in confidence and protect, and shall not use (except as expressly authorized by this Agreement) or disclose, Proprietary Information, unless such Proprietary Information becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement by Participant. 
Participant acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Licensor’s Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of Participant obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow Participant or third parties to unfairly compete with Licensor resulting in irreparable harm to Licensor, and therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, Licensor shall be entitled to injunctions without the requirement to post bond and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law.

<p>Evaluation. Any results of the testing or evaluation of the Software, including without limitation any feedback or suggestions which Participant may provide Licensor (the “Feedback”) shall be deemed Proprietary Information of Licensor and Participant agrees that Licensor shall have the right to use the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose.  Participant agrees that Licensor shall own, and Participant hereby assigns to Licensor, any and all right, title and interest in and to the Feedback.
<p>Data Security and Storage.  As part of the Beta test, the Software may be used to upload or store information or data of Participant.  Licensor agrees that it will not intentionally share such information or data with any third party, except as necessary to conduct the Beta test.  However, Participant acknowledges and agrees that Licensor may not provide any security or data encryption for such information or data.  Additionally, Participant acknowledges and agrees that Licensor may not use any backup or disaster recovery functions as part of the Beta test, and at the end of the Beta test, Licensor may, at its sole discretion, delete any and all information and data of Participant that is stored on the servers or systems that are used for the Beta test.  Accordingly, any information or data submitted or made available by Participant as part of the Beta test will be done so at Participant’s sole risk, and Participant forever releases and discharges Licensor from any claims regarding loss of any such information and data during or after the Beta test.
<p>Warranty Disclaimer.  The parties acknowledge and agree that the Software and its related systems are experimental and are therefore provided “AS-IS” and at Participant’s sole risk. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY TO ANY PERSON RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE AND ITS FUNCTIONALITY, ITS USE OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, THE RESULTS OF ITS USE, THAT ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL EVER BE COMPLETED OR COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS PERMITTING PARTICIPANT TO RELY IN ANY WAY ON THE CONTINUED USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DATA OR INFORMATION STORED BY THE SOFTWARE OR ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIAL RELEASE THEREOF.
Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY FOR ANY (A) LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, (B) DAMAGE TO SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT, (C) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (D) LOSS OR UNREADABILITY OF EMAILS, (E) DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, REVENUES, DATA OR PROFITS, OR (F) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
<p>Term and Termination.  The test period for the Software will be for [sixty (60) days] after the Effective Date subject to extension by Licensor at its sole discretion (“Test Period”). This Agreement will expire at the end of the Test Period provided Licensor or Participant have not terminated this Agreement earlier as provided in the next sentence.  This Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason or no reason upon prior written notice to the other party.  Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Participant will destroy and erase from Participant’s mobile device’s memory the Software and will destroy or return to Licensor all instructions and other material in Participant’s possession related to the Beta test. If requested by Licensor, Participant will certify in writing within three (3) days of the request that Participant has complied with the terms of this provision. 
<p>Effect of Termination.  Upon the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement (“Termination Date”), the License shall immediately terminate.  Upon the Termination Date, Participant shall (i) immediately cease all use of the Software, and (ii) destroy all copies or portions of the Software and any Proprietary Information in Participant’s possession or control.  Sections 3 (“License Restrictions”), 4 (“Ownership”), 5 (“Confidentiality”), 6 (“Evaluation”), 7 (“Data Security and Storage”), 8 (“Warranty Disclaimer”), 9 (“Limitation of Liability”), 10 (“Term and Termination”). 11 (“Effect of Termination”) and 12 (“Miscellaneous”) will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
<p>Miscellaneous.  Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable (by operation of law or otherwise) or transferable by Participant, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect.  This Agreement (including all of Licensor’s rights arising under this Agreement) are freely assignable or transferable by Licensor.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof and Participant submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in the State of California and County of SanTA Clara.  In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supercedes any and all written or oral agreements heretofore existing between the parties.  No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in a writing signed by both parties and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.
<p>(Thanks for putting up with this!)
