  <h1>The FortyTwo Code of Conduct</h1>

  <h2><strong>Part 1: Respect The Code, Respect Our Users</strong></h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Protect me from knowing what I don’t need to know. Protect me from even
    knowing that there are things to know that I don’t know. Protect me from
    knowing that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to
    know about. Amen.”

  <p>Kifi is a powerful tool that gives great value to many users in their
  daily habits. Our users use it for everything, from work to personal uses,
  from browsing to communicating with others. To provide this value, our
  technology and products have great powers, and with this powers comes great
  responsibility.

  <p>Our users are trusting us with their most private information. We expect
  our team at FortyTwo to be respectful not only to each other, but also to our
  users. In order to provide the great value of Kifi to our users we are
  storing information related to our users on our servers. Some information is
  being provided to us explicitly by our users, and some we collect is based on
  users’ behavior while using Kifi.

  <p>Since it is not only our legal but also our moral obligation towards our
  users to make sure that their private information is safe and protected, we
  require all of our employees to understand this code of conduct. This code of
  conduct is meant to guide FortyTwo employees with the proper rules of conduct
  that are required when having access to users’ private information.

  <p>In order to maintain our integrity toward our users and make Kifi not only
  an awesome product, but also a trustworthy one, please read, agree and sign
  this code of conduct in order to make sure that Kifi is not only the best
  product for our users, but also that all of us are obligated to principles of
  trust, privacy and integrity.

  <p>So “Don’t Panic,” just read the code, understand it, and implement its
  principles in your day to day.

  <h2><strong>Part 2: Keeping Private Information Safe</strong></h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Arthur: If I asked you where the hell we were, would I regret it?<br>
    Ford: We’re safe.<br>
    Arthur: Oh good.<br>
    Ford: We’re in a small galley cabin in one of the spaceships of the Vogon
    Constructor Fleet.<br>
    Arthur: Ah, this is obviously some strange use of the word safe that I
    wasn’t previously aware of.”

  <p>FortyTwo’s reputation is not only measured by how good is our product, but
  is also based on the way we protect our users personal and private data
  stored on our servers. In order to maintain our user’s trust, all employees
  should follow the 4.2 rules of privacy:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Know and Follow Kifi’s Privacy Policy</strong><br>
      Our public Privacy Policy (published on <a href="https://www.kifi.com/privacy">kifi.com/privacy</a>) is a binding
      declaration between us and our users. We believe that we should collect
      only the information necessary to provide the great value Kifi. All
      employees must read, know and respect Kifi’s Privacy Policy.

    <li>
      <p><strong>Speak Up</strong><br>
      ​If you think that you are, or any of your colleagues are not following
      this Code of Conduct or FortyTwo’s Privacy Policy, please don’t be quiet
      - speak, report and prevent any behaviour that might compromise Kifi’s
      integrity.

    <li>
      <p><strong>Limit Your Access to Data</strong><br>
      Our users are keeping different pages that they find interesting and
      important. They are also convesing using Kifi on private issues. Looking
      and searching on a user’s kifi data history can tell us a lot about that
      user, but sometimes it can tell us a lot more than they intended for us to
      know. Therefore, even when you are needed to access a specific Kifi
      user’s data, please respect our users’ privacy and do not access any data
      that is not necessary for your work. To be clear, you may not query or
      access a specific user’s data unless it’s:

      <ol type="A">
        <li>To technically investigate or fix a problem related to a suspected
        malfunction with Kifi’s functionality.

        <li>To provide support for this user when the user reports a problem or
        a question.

        <li>To understand behavior when planning or building a feature, not
        targeting a specific user’s personal information.
      </ol>


    <li>
      <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mum's_the_word">Mum’s
      the Word</a></strong><br>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>We do not share or disclose data, aggregated data or any other user
        information with anyone outside of FortyTwo. Remember, even though data
        is collected, it doesn’t mean that it can be shared.

        <li>If you think that disclosure of information is required for any
        reason, consult with with the company’s leadership (Currently: CEO or
        CTO) on whether this information should and can be disclosed. Any
        disclosure of information can only be done after receiving a written
        permission. <!-- The joke is that the last point is 4.2 -->
      </ol>

  </ol>

  <h2><strong>Part 3: Help us improve</strong></h2>

    “Did I do anything wrong today,” he said, “or has the world always been
    like this and I’ve been too wrapped up in myself to notice?”

  <p>If you have any doubts on whether your actions might breach the Code of
  Conduct, feel free to review the Code of Conduct and Privacy Policy and don’t
  hesitate to ask questions. We want you not only to read the code, but to
  actually understand it and help us improve it.

  <h3>We expect all FortyTwo employees to not only read the code, but to follow and
  implement its principles. Breaching the Code of Conduct can not only harm our
  users, but can also harm Kifi’s trustworthiness and in some cases breach the
  law.</h3>
