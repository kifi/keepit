  <p>
  The Kifi Services are owned and operated by Kifi, and the Kifi Services and all intellectual property and other

and all related Kifi content are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark and other laws, and you

not copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, sub-license, sell, reverse

  </p>

  <p>
The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Kifi Services (collectively, the "Trademarks") are the

  </p>


  <h2 id="no-use-by-children-under-13">No Use by Children Under 13</h2>
  <p>
You hereby affirm that you are over the age of 12, as the Kifi Services are not intended for children under 13. If
you are under 13 years of age, then you may not use the Kifi Services. You further affirm that you are fully able
and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set
forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
  </p>


  <h2 id="claims-of-copyright-or-trademark-infringement">Claims of Copyright or Trademark Infringement</h2>
  <p>
  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that
material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Kifi also reviews claims of
trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted or linked to by Kifi infringe your
copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be
removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic
signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
(b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted
works or trademarks or links thereto are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
 (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and
information reasonably sufficient to allow Kifi to locate the material on the Kifi Services; (d) the name, address,
telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining
party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is
accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Kifi will not respond to complaints that do
not meet these requirements. If Kifi determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark
rights do not require removal, Kifi will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the
content or use of the materials unlawful.
  </p>

  <p>
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA
permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name,
address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty
of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you
consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if
your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Kifi may be found, and that you will
accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic
signature (for example, typing your full name).
  </p>

  <p>
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Kifi Services must meet the then-current statutory requirements
imposed by the DMCA (see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright" target="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a> for details)
and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a
notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

  <h2 id="dispute-resolution-governing-law">Dispute Resolution/Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
excluding that body of law relating to conflict of laws. The parties agree that any controversy or claim arising out
of or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach thereof, will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance
with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et seq., and the then-current rules and procedures of JAMS.
The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public. The arbitration will take place in
Mountain View, California and be conducted in the English language. The decision rendered by the arbitrator will
be binding upon the parties hereto, and any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of all federal and state courts in
Santa Clara County, California. Venue will lie exclusively in Santa Clara County, California. For the sake of clarity,
nothing in this paragraph shall affect Kifi's ability to seek from a court injunctive or equitable relief at any time.
If any arbitration or other proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret these Terms of Service or matters relating
to it, the substantially prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator's award, will be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in such arbitration or proceeding from the
other party, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party is entitled; provided that in no event will
the arbitrator have the authority to award punitive damages.
  </p>

  <h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p>
If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that
provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire Agreement between you and us relating to the
subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between
you and us with respect to such subject matter. These Terms of Service may not be changed, waived or modified
except by Kifi as provided herein or otherwise by written instrument signed by Kifi. Neither these Terms of Service
nor any right, obligation, or remedy hereunder is assignable, transferable, delegatable, or sublicensable by you
