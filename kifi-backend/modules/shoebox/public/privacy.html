  <h1>Kifi Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Welcome to kifi.com, a website owned and controlled by FortyTwo Inc. (“Kifi”, “we”, “us”, or
  “our”). We operate the Kifi website, browser extension and mobile application, which help you easily “keep” webpages
  you are interested in, share kept pages with your friends and contacts on a variety of social networks, and add
  comments and messages to kept pages (the “Service”). We provide this Privacy Policy to let you know what information
  we collect, how we use it, share it and protect it.</p>

  <p>By using Kifi, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
  does not apply to information collected by third-party websites and web services linked to or otherwise accessible
  from Kifi. The information collected or received by third-party websites is subject to their own privacy
  policies.</p>

  <p>To enable the Service, including providing you with customized Kifi search results and
  making the webpages you “kept” accessible to you and your social contacts, Kifi occasionally collects some
  information about your browsing history as well as your search queries and results. This information is
  de-identified, encrypted and held securely on our servers without becoming visible to anyone, including our
  employees, except in accordance with your privacy choices.</p>

  <h2 id="principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

  <p>To protect your privacy, we commit to the following principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will give you control over your information and its visibility to other Kifi users.</li>
    <li>We will not collect any information from you except insomuch as collection is necessary to
    provide you with the Service.</li>
    <li>We will protect your browsing history information and search queries we collect. We cannot
    view this information, so furthermore cannot share this information with anyone else.</li>
    <li>To the maximum possible extent, we will use only aggregated information rather than
    personally identified or identifiable information.</li>
    <li>We will not store any of the personal content you may have on web pages you visit. Specifically, we will
    not record any passwords, credit card or financial account details. However, when you keep a page, we do store
    the page title, URL, and the date you kept the page.</li>
    <li>Any personal information that you provide will be secured using industry standard protocols
    and technology.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="how-we-secure-your-history">How Do We Secure Your Private Click and Browsing History?</h3>

  <p>Occasionally, we have to collect some information regarding parts of your browsing history in order to provide you
  with better search results and experience. This information may include your User ID and the URL you visited.</p>

  <p>To protect your privacy, we chose to use specific technological techniques (such as time-decaying
  one-way hash filters) to store it in a way that prevents us or anyone else from easily querying or viewing your
  browsing history. Specifically, even if we were forced to give information related to your browsing or click history,
  our methods do not allow for direct retrieval; instead, we compute a signature of many combined data points. We could
  only tell probabilistically (with high false positive and false negative results) whether the data was previously
  stored, with certainty declining over time.</p>

  <p>Whenever we will refer to a “Secured Manner” hereinafter, we will mean the technological
  techniques mentioned in this article.</p>

  <h2 id="collection">Collection of Information</h2>

  <h3 id="login">Login</h3>

  <p>In order to become a Kifi user, you will register to the Service or log in using your social login.
  This means that upon your first login, Kifi collects your full name and email address, profile photo, gender,
  languages, devices and list of friends from the social network you connect through. Kifi is a social product,
  providing you added value by learning from the search queries and results of your social contacts. This is why when
  you login, we collect information about your friends, friends of friends, followers and social contacts. This
  information is used to improve your social search capabilities and enable you to communicate with your social
  contacts through the Service, for example with messages.</p>

  <p>In addition, when you first login, Kifi, upon your approval, logs all
  of your existing bookmarks and retains them as privately kept pages for your future reference.</p>

  <h3 id="search-history">Search History</h3>

  <p>Every time you search the Internet and click on a result, Kifi collects
  information about your search and choice of results in order to improve and personalize the Kifi search results that
  you and other Kifi users get. Specifically, Kifi collects your Kifi user ID ; the search query you
  searched and its URL; the result you selected and the time you selected it; and whether the result you selected was
  provided by Kifi or by an organic search engine. We do not store this information in an easily
  retrievable form (see “Secured manner” for more information).</p>

  <h3 id="browsing-history">Browsing History</h3>

  <h4>To Improve the Keeper’s Behavior</h4>

  <p>When you visit a webpage, we transfer, but do not store, the page’s URL to our servers to retrieve whether:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You have previously kept the page</li>
    <li>Your connections or others have kept the page</li>
    <li>The page has any special settings, such as a custom Keeper position, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not store any of this information in any manner.</p>

  <p>In order to improve the operation of the Kifi Keeper (which appears at the bottom right corner of
  your screen when you use Kifi) and avoid bothering you with repetitive prompts, when the Keeper opens on a page, we
  transmit the URL and store in a way that we cannot easily retrieve (see “Secured Manner”), so that we do not
  automatically open the Keeper in the future.</p>

  <h4>To Improve Your Search Results’ Quality</h4>

  <p>Additionally, to improve search quality, we may transmit the URL for pages that (1) we have
  previously seen, (2) we deem as useful for you, so that we improve search results for related pages. As before, we do
  not store this in any format that is easily retrievable (see “Secured Manner”). This information will always be kept
  private and used strictly to improve the Kifi search results.</p>

  <p>We improve Kifi search results through a fully automated process performed by machine analysis;
  your browsing history will never be seen or monitored by anybody, including our employees.</p>

  <p>If you actively choose to run Kifi while browsing in “private”, “incognito” or an equivalent
  mode, Kifi will not collect information about your click or browsing history when you browse in such a
  mode.</p>

  <h4 id="technical-information">Technical information</h4>

  <p>We collect and store certain technical information when you use Kifi, including the type of
  operating system you are using; Internet protocol address; browser type; other
  information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider.</p>

  <h4 id="cookies">Cookies</h4>

  <p>We may use cookies (pieces of data stored on your computer tied to information about you) to
  enhance and personalize your experience on Kifi; help authenticate your identity when you visit and transact with
  Kifi; remember your preferences and login information; present and help measure and research the effectiveness of
  Kifi offerings; and customize the content provided to you by Kifi.</p>

  <h2 id="usage-statistics">Usage statistics</h2>

  <p>We may track usage statistics in order to monitor and improve the Service performance and
  features. Usage information is retained in identified form. It includes some information about a user’s engagement
  with a web page (as mentioned on the “browsing history” section above), including
  interaction with the Kifi interface itself. For example, Kifi would retain the number of keeps a specific user made
  per day, or the number of clicks a keep recieved from search results, in aggregate.</p>

  <h2 id="your-correspondence">Your Correspondence</h2>

  <p>If you contact us for any reason (by sending us an email, fax, Kifi
  messaging, or completing a form on our website), we may keep a record of that correspondence in order to
  refer to it when investigating the issue you have raised.&nbsp; We will not make your email
  address available to third parties without your explicit permission.</p>

  <h2 id="choices">Your Privacy Choices</h2>

  <p>Kifi is a social product, learning from the search queries and search results of your social
  contacts and allowing you to interact with social contacts in the context of existing web-pages. It is important that
  you take a minute to learn and understand the privacy defaults and choices you can make on the Service.</p>

  <h2 id="keeping">Keeping Webpages</h2>

  <p>Any webpages that you choose to “keep” are, by default, viewable by your social
  contacts who use Kifi. They will be able to see that you “kept” a certain webpage when they
  make a related query in a search engine or on Kifi.com, which will appear to them in conjunction with
  your name and profile photo. <span class="c7">You can choose to “keep” a webpage privately, in which case your
  social contacts will not be able to see that you “kept” it</span>. Kifi, however, will record that you “kept” a
  webpage privately, in order to provide you with access to that webpage when you later search for it again. If you
  “keep” pages that are protected behind a login wall, such as your personal email messages or social networking posts,
  those pages will be, by default, “kept” privately and not accessible by your social contacts.</p>

  <h2 id="kifi-messages">Kifi Messages</h2>

  <p>Kifi allows you to post messages on selected web pages to specific social contacts, even if they
  do not use Kifi. These messages are only viewable by those social contacts with whom you have selected to share them.
  If they are not Kifi users themselves, the recipients of such a message will be directed to the webpage in
  topic.</p>

  <h2 id="deleting-information">Deleting your information</h2>

  <p>You can choose to permanently remove all your information from Kifi and terminate your profile,
  through your profile settings on the Kifi website, in which case all information associated with you will be deleted.
  To delete your Kifi user and information, contact us <a href="http://support.kifi.com/customer/portal/emails/new">here</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="using-information">Using Your Information</h2>

  <p>Your information is stored on our servers or on the servers of our storage service providers,
  which are located in the U.S. or the EU, and used to operate and improve the Service; to conduct research about your
  use of the Service; to personalize the content and advertisements provided to you; and to communicate with you and
  respond to your inquiries.</p>

  <p>We use elements of your browsing history and search queries to provide you with the Service,
  including to improve and personalize the Kifi search results that you and other Kifi users get and to enable you to
  communicate with your social contacts who use Kifi.</p>

  <p>We may contact you to tell you about new features, service issues or changes to this Privacy
  Policy.</p>

  <p>We will use your information to notify you when there has been any activity relating to your
  profile, such as messages from your social contacts.</p>

  <p>We may use your browsing information and search queries in an aggregated, completely anonymous
  manner to highlight trends and patterns in the way that Kifi users use the web.</p>

  <h2 id="sharing-information">Sharing Your Information</h2>

  <p>We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such
  sharing is (a) permitted by you, (b) reasonably necessary to offer the service, or (c) legally required.</p>

  <p>Your browsing history and search queries will not be accessible by anyone, not even our
  employees, unless you so choose (for example, by publicly “keeping” a page).</p>

  <p>As discussed above, you may decide to share your information, including “kept” web pages and
  messages with your social contacts who use Kifi or with all Kifi users.</p>

  <p>We may disclose your information to certain trusted third-party providers we use to help provide
  the Service to you. For example, we may use a provider to host our website and to provide data processing activities.
  In this case, we will remain responsible for your information and contractually bind any third-party provider to act
  strictly on our instructions.</p>

  <p>We may be required to disclose certain data under legal process, including a court order, search
  warrant or subpoena. Even if we were so required to share a user’s browsing history or search queries, it would be
  extremely difficult to identify which information belonged to what user.</p>

  <p>In the event that ownership of FortyTwo Inc., or individual business units owned by FortyTwo
  Inc., was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your information may be
  transferred to the new owner so the Service can continue. In any such transfer of information, your user information
  would remain subject to the promises made in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2 id="security">Security</h2>

  <p>We deploy industry standard security safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse
  of your information. At the same time, we cannot guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner
  inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate
  applicable law or agreements). To protect your privacy and security, Kifi uses social networks login to help verify
  your identity before granting access or making corrections to any of your information.</p>

  <h2 id="children">Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>Kifi is intended for a general audience. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to be on
  social networks, nor are they permitted to sign up or log in to Kifi.</p>

  <h2 id="changes">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should review it periodically. If
  there are significant changes to FortyTwo's information practices, you will be provided with appropriate online
  notice. You may be provided with additional privacy-related information in connection with special features and
  services that may be introduced in the future.</p>

  <h2 id="contact">How To Contact Us</h2>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or its implementation, please contact us <a href="http://support.kifi.com/customer/portal/emails/new">here</a>.</p>
