      Continuing will remove {{ modalData.member | name }}'s access to content that is only visible to {{ modalData.organization | name }}.
      They will still have access to your organization's public libraries and any content they have been explicitly invited to follow or collaborate on.
    </p>
    <p>{{ modalData.member.firstName }} will not receive a notification and you can invite them back at any time.</p>
