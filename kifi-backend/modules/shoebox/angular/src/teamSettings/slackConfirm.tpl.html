  Section 2
  If the user is currently in Chrome or FFX with an installed extension >  hide this section
  If the user is in Chrome or FFX and no installed extension >  Buttons to install  (I don't care if they ever installed in the past, only if they are currently on a browser with it)
  If the user is in IE, Safari, etc then buttons to download Chrome or FFX mentioning our awesome extension (same buttons we have on the /install page when you hit it on IE)

  Section 3

  Button to visit newly sync'd team (ideally less obvious than the install CTA).
